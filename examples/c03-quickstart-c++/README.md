# Objectives

- Give some examples of basic C++ usage for students who know how to program, but may not have used
  C++ much before, can use to get started quickly on class assignments.
- Introduce some of the still old/idiosyncratic syntax and usage of C++ multi-file projects.
- Look at modern I/O and string processing provided by C++ standard libraries.
- Quick review of C++ class syntax and object oriented programming idioms defined by C++.
- Introduction to the modern C++ standard template library, which provides for more high-level
  containers and data types comparable to modern languages, like resizable lists and map (dictionary)
  data types.

# Description

The purpose of this project is to provide students who are familiar with programming in languages
such as Java and Python, a few of the helpful things to know about writing programs in C++ for
class assignments.  There are several small examples meant to give a quick introduction to using C++
effectively for our classes.  

The examples covered in this project include:

- Compiling, multi-file projects
- Standard I/O streams and using `cin` / `cout`
- Using C++ `string`s
- OO Programming and C++ `class`
- Basics of using the Standard Template Library (STL)
  - `vector` and `list` containers
  - `map`s
  - `queue`s, `stack`s and Priority Queues
  - Iterators and Algorithms

# Additional Information

The following are suggested online materials you may use to get more information and
help about learning the basics and more advanced aspects of programming in C++:

- [cplusplus.com Tutorials and Reference](https://cplusplus.com/) Has both some okish tutorials on C++
  and a pretty good reference for C and C++ librarys, including STL.
- [Programiz.com Introduction to C++](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/getting-started) has
  tutorials / courses you can pay for, but the free overviews are helpful quick starts for
  people who know how to program to pick up modern C++ and the STL
